## Basic Reddit Client

- This client is mostly URL driven. To use, visit localhost:3000
- There is no search dropdown, but if the subreddit exists you will be taken to a url that contains the name of the subreddit (ex:  http://localhost:3000/oakland/0)
- Any subsequent URL generated by hitting next/prev can be copied and pasted
- This client checks for updates every minute
- To visit another subreddit, navigate back to localhost:3000
